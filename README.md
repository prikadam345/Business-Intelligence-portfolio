## Projects

### 1. Detecting Emerging Payment Fraud Patterns
**Business Problem:** Visa needs to detect card-not-present payment fraud in real time to reduce financial risk.

**Approach:**  
- Generated realistic synthetic transaction data (50k+ records) simulating Visa payment patterns  
- Applied **anomaly detection rules** in Python (velocity checks, geographic anomalies)  
- Visualized patterns using Tableau (heatmaps, time series, merchant risk table)

**Dashboard:**

*(Interactive Tableau Public link coming soon)*

**Insights & Recommendations:**  
- Identified high-risk merchants and regions  
- Recommended actions: temporarily freeze suspicious merchants, increase review threshold during spikes  

**Code & Data:** [Python scripts & CSV data](code/fraud_analysis.py)

### 2. Self-Service Analytics Dashboard
**Business Problem:** Finance teams spend ~10 hours/week manually generating reports and need autonomy to explore transaction data.

**Approach:**  
- Built a **user-centric dashboard** with filters (region, product, date), drill-downs, and KPIs  
- Created ETL scripts to generate clean data for finance reporting  
- Added tooltips explaining key metrics (Net Settlement, Authorization Rate)  

**Dashboard:**

**Insights & Recommendations:**  
- Finance teams can now answer questions without analyst intervention  
- Estimated **time savings:** ~8 hours/week  
- Mock adoption plan: training slides, FAQ document  

**Code & Data:** [Python scripts & CSV data](code/self_service_etl.py)

### 3. Revenue Forecasting & Scenario Planning
**Business Problem:**  leadership wants to understand TPV trends under economic volatility to make strategic decisions.

**Approach:**  
- Built scenario-based forecasting dashboards in Tableau  
- Modeled macroeconomic impacts using Python (Inflation, Currency Fluctuation, Cross-border volumes)  
- Added toggles for scenarios: Holiday Surge, Recession Mode  

**Dashboard:**

**Insights & Recommendations:**  
- Provides leadership actionable insights under various scenarios  
- Examples: If EU growth slows 20%, TPV drops $1.2B quarterly  
- Recommended next steps: quarterly scenario review, proactive marketing strategies
